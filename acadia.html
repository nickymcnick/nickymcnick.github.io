        <h3>THE CLIENT</h3>
        <p>Acadia is a pub in Minneapolis, Minnesota housed in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood on the border of the Univeristy of Minnesota campus. It is a bar frequented by students and faculty of the university and young professionals from the city. It has a selection of pub food and 30 craft brews on tap that change almost daily. And it provides entertainment almost 7 days a week for it's customers.</p>
        <h3>THE CHALLENGE</h3>
        <p>Acadia's website is simple and yet it has a few usability issues. The intention of the website is to inform visitors of their menu of food and drinks, as well as, the variety of events happening in the space. While moving through the website I found what seemed like dead ends and moments of confusion when something I expected to happen didn't. I propose some simple changes that will ease the general navigation of the site to make it more intuitive for the user and will present information more readily.
        <h3>MY APPROACH</h3>
        <p>The first thing I did was go through the website and found every page to map the general structute of the page to what the client wants it's visitors to know. From there I tried to consolidate categories and create less steps to find specific information. For example, inseatd of going to 'food' and then clicking on a link to download a PDF, the menu could appear on that page.</p>
        <p>Second, I wrote a few questions about the site and added a few tasks to complete and gave the survey to some Acadia customers and also asked that they go to the pub and report back. The information I got back confirmed some of my initial ideas about the page, it brought up some things I didn't notice and debunked a few of my theories surrounding the overall style of the page compared to the style of the physical space.</p>
        <p>Lastly, taking all of this into consideration, I created a few user personas and created an updated sitemap with fewer pages that were more intuitive for these personas to find the information they needed. I created a few wireframes to reflect these changes. These include: a homepage with an image of the bar, a schedule of the week's events, a showcase of socialmedia elements such as instagram, and a footer with basic information that would be present on all pages. I also created a page for the menu that didn't involve downloading a PDF, which would also help when a user went to the website on their mobile device. According to my user surveys the calendar page is well presented on a computer, just a few changes in copy that would imply that there is more happening at the pub other than just live music. On a mobile device the calendar page would have to change to accomodate the smaller screen.</p>
        <h3>PERSONAS</h3>
        <h4>The College Student</h4>
        <p>Acadia is a place for those looking to have a beer with friends after classes or attend a free live music event. They are looking at the page with their phone or laptop for information on the events happening and the happy hour schedule and deals.</p>
        <h4>The Young Professional</h4>
        <p>These patrons are drawn to Acadia because it reminds them of their college days but isn't filled with undergraduates. They are looking for a place with good food that has deals and adds to the craft brew culture of the city. They might be looking for some live music or events, or they might want to make sure they'll be able to catch up with friends so the calendar of events is important.</p>
        <h4>The University Faculty Member</h4>
        <p>Acadia is close to the university campus and can offer a comfortable setting for a nice meal with other collegues or students. It is also a place that represents the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood and can give a good example of what the West Bank has to offer for guests.</p>
