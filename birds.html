      <h1 class="work-title">"The Birds" | Puppet Design &#38; Construction</h1>
      <section>
        <p>In 2010 the University of Minnesota Theater department produced a collaborative version of Aristophanes’ greek comedy “The Birds”. The overall design concept of this production was reused and recycled materials. Everything from the costumes to the hand held items were created from reusing all kinds of materials. I became involved by designing and constructing the two hand puppets used by the protagonists and a few other puppets for a couple scenes.</p>

          </li>
          <li class="work-right">
            <p>At first I constructed a prototype with the goal of creating a puppet that could easily be put on and taken off, but could also believably move like a bird. The solution was a hand puppet that was loose around the wrist. These prototypes lead to discoveries of small details that were then improved in the next iteration.</p>

          </li>
          <li class="work-right">
            <p>The puppets also have articulating wings. Through research of the anatomy and mechanics of bird wings, as well as, trial and error I was able to construct pair of wings that folded in and layed on top of the arm and could also stretch out.</p>

            </a>
          </li>
          <li class="work-right">
            <p>Once painted and finalized the bird puppets took to the stage where they blended seamlessly with the aesthetic of the other designers. Considering the cardboard construction and use, the puppets lasted in decent conditions the five week run.</p>
