      <section>
        <p>This chair design was born out of a group project in which each member came up with a concept for a chair that would be fabricated by the team. Each team member presented their design and one design was chosen. My design for the “Kylie” chair was chosen for our group. The inspiration for this chair came from the research I did on designer chairs and from my familiarity with the Knoll, Inc. designs I encountered by cleaning their Minneapolis, MN office. I chose to emulate a midcentury soft lines and combination of medium dark woods with an interesting fabric. </p>
        <p>After deciding on the look of the chair I researched the standard strengths and measurements used for lounge chair and sitting chairs. Taking these points of data into mind I shaped my design to accommodate for the function of the chair. A 3D model was created for the purposes of creating manufacturing drawings and a virtual strength model. The model went through various stress tests to test whether the average person would be held by the structure. The manufacturing drawings created a template for cutting out each of the shapes and provided a bill of materials needed to fabricate the chair. These drawings would also ensure the future fabrication of more chairs.</p>

      <section class="last-comment">
        <p>The chair went together quite well in two weeks. The other members of the team added their knowledge of interior design and upholstery to solve issues encountered with the original stain color and the padding of the backing which actually makes the final look more cohesive.</p>
        <p>The chair does have design flaws that would need to be taken into consideration in its next iteration. It does hold up to 200 lbs and currently sits in my living room adding a touch of class to my home.</p>
