<!-- MAIN CONTENT -->

    <div id="wrapper">
      <h1 class="work-title">cove</h1>
      <section>
        <p>cove is a neighborhood productive space where individuals can get things done. As part of my time at the Startup Institute full-time program I had the pleasure of working in a team of four with cove to understand the brand and build a member appreciation calendar including a welcome package.</p>
        <p>The member appreciation calendar consists of gifts given to members at specific moments in the length of the member life. For example upon subscribing to the cove plans a member will receive a welcome package. This includes a brochure welcoming the member to cove and its community, as well as, a location specific insert that highlights points of interest around that cove location and cove branded office supplies like a note pad and pen. Once the member has been there for two weeks another item is given to the member. Then again at one month, five months, etc. Taking data on how long members use cove, we put together a schedule of items designed to show the member appreciation for their continued subscription.</p>

          </li>
          <li class="work-right">
            <p>These examples specifically show the process of thinking and designing the cove welcome brochure and location insert. The biggest elements taken into consideration for the content and design here are getting the member to sign up for the social feature of the cove app and welcoming them into a community people also getting things done. For practicality the welcome brochure is a general welcome to cove and a reminder of the amenities each member can enjoy.</p>

          </li>
          <li class="work-right">
            <p>Since cove has several locations throughout the city a location specific insert was thought to facilitate the printing process. The insert would have an image of the cove location, a map with a legend showing points of interest like public transportation, restaurants and places to continue being productive like the post office.</p>

          <li class="work-right">
            <p>One of the main reasons to create this welcome brochure is to fully onboard the member into cove. The object of the “how to” guide is to ensure that the member has the app set up in their phone, sets a social account through the app and connects their computer to the printer.</p>
